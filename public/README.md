How not to mess things up while setting up Swapidy from scratch:
I'm assuming you would be able to clone the file on your computer.
I'm controlling versioning using rvm. Its great.
Now time to hook heroku so that you can deploy

1) Send an email to PJ (pulkit@swapidy.com) and he'll add you as a collaborator.
2) Read https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart and learn how to login using cl/terminal.
3) Now, run git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:swapidy-test.git
4) Acid test: try git remote and if you see heroku along with origin, you're good. Otherwise you can look up stuff on stackoverflow and theres extensive documentation.
5) Congrats if you made it this far. Now remember to always git fetch --all before git push heroku master

Everytime you pull, make sure you run the db initialization script: rake swapidy:db:reset

If you don't see any js function getting executed, you should run rake assets:precompile
